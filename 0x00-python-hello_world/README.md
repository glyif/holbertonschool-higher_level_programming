# 0x00. Python - Hello, World
## Author: Bobby Yang (Batch 2)

## Synopsis
This is the pilot assignment for python. This project went over what Python was, how to write python scripts, python formating and print formatting.

We are using `Python 3.4.3`

## File Breakdown
### 0-run:
This is a bash file that runs a python program that is stored in an environmental variable called $PYFILE.

### 1-run-inline
This is a bash file that runs an inline python script that is stored in an environmental variable called $PYFILE.

### 2-print.py
This python script prints a string with an escaped character.

### 3-print_number.py
This python script prints a integer stored in a variable preceeding a string.

### 4-print_float.py
This python script prints a 2 decimal float.

### 5-print_string.py
This python script prints a string 3 times followed by a new line then part of the same string.

### 6-concat.py
This python script prints a concatenated string.

### 7-edges.py
This python script prints 3 different parts of a string.

### 8-concat_edges.py
This python script prints a string that is concated from different parts of a bigger string. Lots of counting involved.

### 9-easter_egg.py
This python script uses a python easter egg to print the `The Zen of Python`.


## Using
The two bash files can be run like running any bash files.

I.E.
```bash
$ ./0-run
```

The python scripts will be run with python3.

I.E.
```bash
$ python3 2-print.py
```
